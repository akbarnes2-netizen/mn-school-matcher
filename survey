        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:Teal; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This page contains a survey where you will be asked some questions about your student and will rank the importance of a variety of school qualities, all which will help you find the best match for your child. </h2>
        
        <form action="/results" method="POST">
          <h2 style="text-align: center; color:Teal; font-family: Georgia, serif;">17 school qualities are listed below. Each quality contains a description of its measurements and significance.</h2>
          <p style="text-align: center; color:Teal; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Please rank each quality from 1 to 17, based on how important it is for you personally. Here, 1 stands for the highest importance. If a quality is completely unimportant to you, enter a 0. This will make the total (lowest rank) less than 17. Once you have filled out the form and clicked submit, your matched schools will appear, from closest match onwards.</p>
